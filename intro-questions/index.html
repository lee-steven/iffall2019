                <li>My name is Steven Lee a Senior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Design.</li>
                <li>I have a bit of experience using HTML, CSS, and Javascript and wanted to improve my web design skills.</li>
                <li>I think I'm pretty proficient in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have created a few projects over the summer like a calculator, todo list, etc. to get better.</li>
                <li>I hope to learn design concepts to make web pages dynamic and easy to navigate and, of course, make my websites aesthetically pleasing.</li>
                <li>It's probably going to be much more difficult placing things where I want them on a web page .</li>
                <li><a href=https://www.moma.org/>Moma's</a> website is simple yet beautiful with its bright colors and big, bold font.</li>
                <li>I think <a href=https://vimeo.com/>Vimeo</a> communicates what their product/company is very clearly. Their web design flows naturally and keeps the eye moving downwards.</li>
                <li>The<a href=https://www.nytimes.com/> New York Times</a> creatively transitioned from paper to digital and to this day functions as the go to newspaper for many people.</li>
