                    Cheryl and Sandra both New York City natives, met while studying Nursing 
                    at Queensborough Community College. (wiki). The two became close friends, 
                    and soon after meeting, met Hurby “Luv Bug Azor", who was studying record 
                    production at the Center of Media Arts at the time. The trio soon produced
                    the single “The Showstoppa”. This would be the first single from the 
                    infamous NYC chart-topping group group, Salt-N-Pepa.

                    After the single release, the goru signed to Next Plateau Entertainment, 
                    now known as Next Plateau Records, releasing their debut album Hot, 
                    Cool & Vicious in 1986. The following year, 15 year old DJ Deidra 
                    “Spinderella” Roper was recruited into the group. Coming into the 
                    very male heavy world of 90’s Hip Hop, these three ladies, with the 
                    management of Hurby Azor, Salt’s then boyfriend, would come to be 
                    known as the showstopping Salt-N-Pepa. They would make history as 
                    one of the first female rap groups ever; the “first ladies” of rap.

                        women in nightclubs (icon). This does more than make a ctahcy commercially

                        men and women in terms of sexual expression and engagement in sexual acts.

                        debut and 3rd albums Hot, Cool, & Vicious acquiring platinum status, their 
                        second album A Salt with a Deadly Pepa reaching gold status, and reaching 
                        #1 of various RnB and Hip Hop charts. Not to mention several Grammy 
                        nominations, and one Grammy win. Songs such as “Let’s Talk About Sex” and 
                        “Push It” would shape the legacy the group would leave, as a femme rap group 
                        making art about feminity and sex unapoloogetically.
