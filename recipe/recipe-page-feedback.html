    <h2>Feedback from Lucy Chen</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The color scheme and type styling of the recipe is very good</li>

		<li>I also like the "4 servings" section. I think there are a couple places that could use better spacing. For example before "Ingredients" there should be more space.</li>

		<li>Within the ingredients themselves the spacing could be smaller so that it fits more closely together since people often will shop looking at the ingredients of a recipe page. </li>

		<li>In the Preparation section I think you could make the space between each "Step 1" and the actual step to link them together since they are all evenly spaced and you can't tell which step the image is for.</li>

		<li>Then lastly, reviews aren't often in a paragraph style so maybe change them to some other kind of style.</li>

		<li>Also I feel like "Reviews" should be the same type style as "Ingredients" with the grey background.</li>

		<li>Lastly I think there could be some blank space at the end so that we know it ends. </li>

		<li>Also is it necessary to have them hamburger menu? I love the images, it looks so yummy.</li>
    </ul>
