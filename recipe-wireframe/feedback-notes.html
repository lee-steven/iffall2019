    <h2>Feedback from Bread/Miles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>"I'm smart enough to know you're a phone" -Abram</li>

		<li>For text that has higher emphasis (ie: "Step 1"), you might want to put it in color (instead of black) or bold it. This would help you differentiate it further from the body copy.</li>

		<li>For the reviews, add a space in between the name and the |, ie: "Bob | 10/15/19"</li>

		<li>Helvetica nueue doesn't necessarily work that well for web</li>

		<li>Do your images have to be the full width of the screen? They're a little overpowering, esp in comparison to the instructions</li>

		<li>Overall your website looks like a website but a little outdated due to your font choices (the script for "cooking" and Helvetica Neue), the line (before the description "Fiery, hearty...", the gray rectangles.</li>

		<li>Why is the body copy of the reviews bolded?</li>

		<li>Round the "Write a review" box corners</li>

		<li>Why does "Reviews" not have the gray box behind it like "Ingredients" and "Preparations" do?</li>

		<li>Your ingredients list is kind of confusing in terms of differentiating between different items. The ones that are more than 1 line look like they're their own ingredient on the second line due to your line spacing/line height. I'd find some way to separate items, such as having bullet points or fixing the line spacing/height.</li>
    </ul>
