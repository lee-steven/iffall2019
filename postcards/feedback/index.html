            <h3>AESTHETIC</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Images have a lot of whitespace which means a lot of space to play around with the text, trying playing with different positions of the text.</li>
                <li>Again since there is a lot of white space, consider playing with adding background color or something kind of "filter" to the image.</li>
                <li>Try different fonts! You have a lot of room for creating an even more dynamic/interesting postcard.</li>
                <li>Play with different font weights and text decoration.</li>
                <li>I know you're having trouble finding quality images of this, but try to find a more busy image to contrast with the more simple ones.</li>
                <li>Try to find images that take up the whole width and height of the page.</li>
                <li>For the first postcard, you could create bigger font to accentuate the dynamic image.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h3>STRUCTURE</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Currently structure is very much centered text and image, try to play around with the hierarchy.</li>
                <li>Not much to say about the structure, nothing is conflicting with each other because images aren't too busy.</li>
            </ul>
